# TODO: Write a function called divisible_by_7. 
# This function must take an integer as a parameter.
# This function must return True if the passed integer
# is divisible by 7 or false if not.
# Note: you should not prompt the user for input. 


# TODO: Write a function called compare_it that takes two parameters. 
# You should first test if both parameters are integers.
# If not, return False
# Then you should test if the parameters are equal.
# If they are not, return False
# Finally, test if the parameters are greater than zero.
# If they are not, return False.
# If all of these tests pass, return True.


# TODO: Write a function called keyword_counter that takes three parameters
# Parameter one should be a list of words.
# The second should be set to None by default, and could hold a string to search.
# The third should be set to None by default, and could hold a filename to search.
# If a string and a filename are both passed to the program, the program should 
# return None.
# If the function is passed a string in the second parameter, then it should
# search the string.
# If the function is passed a filename in the third parameter, then it should
# read the file and search the contents of the file.
# Unless the function is passed both a string and a filename, your function 
# must return a dictionary with the keywords as the key and the count of 
# occurrences of that keyword as the value as follows:
# output = {'word': 3, 'second': 4} 
# assuming word is one of the search words and occurs 3 times. 
# Since this is tricky, I've given you the code to read from a file that you'll
# need to include in your function.
# NOTE: Your test should not be case sensitive so if
# one of the words is "fish" your function should count 
# "fish", "Fish", "FISH" or any other combination of 
# capitalization as an occurrence. 
file_name = "test6_1.txt" # DELETE THIS LINE before you build the function.
with open(file_name, "r") as f:
